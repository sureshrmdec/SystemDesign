Deadlock
Resource A and resource B are used by process X and process Y

X starts to use A.
X and Y try to start using B
Y 'wins' and gets B first
now Y needs to use A
A is locked by X, which is waiting for Y

Ways to avoid having deadlocks are:

avoid having locks (if possible)
avoid having more than one lock
always take the locks in the same order.

```java
public class TestThread {
   public static Object Lock1 = new Object();
   public static Object Lock2 = new Object();
   
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      ThreadDemo1 T1 = new ThreadDemo1();
      ThreadDemo2 T2 = new ThreadDemo2();
      T1.start();
      T2.start();
   }
   
   private static class ThreadDemo1 extends Thread {
      public void run() {
         synchronized (Lock1) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1...");
            
            try { Thread.sleep(10); }
            catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for lock 2...");
            
            synchronized (Lock2) {
               System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1 & 2...");

Livelock

A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. As with deadlock, livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked â€” they are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work. This is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor: Alphonse moves to his left to let Gaston pass, while Gaston moves to his right to let Alphonse pass. Seeing that they are still blocking each other, Alphone moves to his right, while Gaston moves to his left. They're still blocking each other, so...

Starvation

Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.


Imagine in you're in a queue to pay get food at a restaurant, for which pregnant woman has priority. And there's just a whole bunch of pregnant women arriving all the time.

You'll soon be starving ;)

Now imagine you are a low-priority process and the pregnant women are higher priority ones =)

Hope this illustration helps hehe
